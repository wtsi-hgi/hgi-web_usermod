User module for HGI-web, implementing role-based access control (RBAC). 

To install, clone the github repository, change into hgi-web_usermod, and run Scala Built Tool (sbt).

You can also use the sbt bootstrapping script from https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras by running:

wget -O ./sbt https://raw.github.com/paulp/sbt-extras/master/sbt
chmod a+x ./sbt
./sbt

That should install all prerequisites and leave you at the sbt project shell:
[hgi-web_usermod] $

From which you can enter the play console:
[hgi-web_usermod] $ play

After which you can start a dev instance (in this case on port 9000) by running:
[hgi-web_usermod] $ run 9000

JVM versions lower than 1.7 may have errors on dome Linux machines relating to memory allocation after a fork (`java.io.IOException: error=12`) when running `sbt`. This can be solved by moving to JVM 1.7, or potentially by turning virtual memory overcommit on in the kernel (`echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory`).
